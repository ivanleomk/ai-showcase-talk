# The Core Approach

![](./d2.svg)

<!--
Traditional approaches to conversation analysis often rely on manual review, which limits how many conversations you can analyze and introduces human bias.

In contrast, Kura uses language models to summarize conversations and identify patterns at scale. This approach allows for:

* Processing thousands of conversations in minutes
* Finding patterns a human might miss
* Adapting to new topics as they emerge
