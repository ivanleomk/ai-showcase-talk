<!--
As AI assistants and chatbots become more prevalent, companies are drowning in conversation data. Most customer interactions are now unstructured text rather than structured clicks or form submissions.
Manual review simply doesn't scale - a typical company might have thousands or even millions of conversations monthly.
Human reviewers introduce bias and can miss important patterns that appear across hundreds of conversations.
This creates a gap where valuable customer feedback and usage patterns remain hidden in plain sight.
