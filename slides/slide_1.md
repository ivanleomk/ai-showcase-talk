<!--
Let's start by understanding what Kura is.

[click] Kura is an open-source tool designed to help you make sense of user data, particularly conversation data, using language models like Gemini.

[click] It's built with the same underlying principles as Anthropic's CLIO system, but made available as an open-source project so you can use it with your own data.

[click] The core functionality involves iteratively summarizing and clustering conversations to reveal broad usage patterns, helping you identify which features to prioritize or which issues to fix.
