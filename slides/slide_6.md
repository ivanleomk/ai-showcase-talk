# Presenter Notes: Beyond Topic Modeling

One of the biggest challenges companies face today is finding broad usage patterns in their customer interactions and understanding where to invest their resources. We collect mountains of user interaction data, but without clear categories and insights from domain experts, this data remains largely untapped.

## Feature Prioritization

- The real power of topic modeling isn't just categorization—it's using those categories to drive strategic decisions
- It's incredibly difficult to know what features to build next when you're drowning in unstructured feedback
- Most importantly you need to know what to say no to and what to agree to
- Kura helps you map actual usage volumes to feature requests, showing you exactly where users are spending their time


## Gap Analysis
[CLICK]
- Sometimes the problem isn't your AI or your algorithms—it's simply that you're missing critical inventory or capabilities
- Let me share a real example from DoorDash: They discovered through conversation analysis that customers were frequently searching for Greek restaurants, but satisfaction ratings for these searches were extremely low
- The solution wasn't a better recommendation algorithm or prompt engineering—it was identifying the inventory gap
- Their response? They purchased 10,000 iPads and distributed them to Greek restaurants across America to bring them onto the platform
- This inventory solution delivered far more value than any algorithm improvement could have

## Targeted Improvement
[CLICK]
- Once you identify specific patterns worth investing in, you can build specialized solutions
- For another client, we discovered users were constantly asking about document modification dates
- The issue wasn't that their search algorithm was poor—they simply weren't storing or tracking modification dates at all
- A simple database schema change and tracking implementation solved what appeared to be an AI problem
- For areas that do need AI improvements, Kura helps you generate synthetic data to train specialized classifiers

The fundamental insight here is that without systematically tracking and categorizing customer interactions, companies make investments based on assumptions rather than evidence. Topic modeling gives you the data to know what to invest in—and equally important, what to say no to.

When you're operating at scale, the highest-ROI improvements often aren't about better prompts or switching to a more powerful model—they're about fixing fundamental inventory or capability gaps that your customers are actually experiencing.
